# What is Abysmia?
Abysmia's goal is to provide a challenging experience with various magical and fantastical additions, such as [Ice and Fire](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ice-and-fire-dragons)'s dragons, [Requiem](https://modrinth.com/mod/requiem)'s overhauled death system, and [AbyssalCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/abyssalcraft)'s rituals and dimensions. It started as a small personal modpack for myself, but I found the experience quite enjoyable, and thought I would share it. 

# IMPORTANT
Abysmia is still in early development. As such, expect unstability. If you don't mind taking the time, you can report any bugs as well as share your suggestions [here](https://github.com/StellarWitch7/Abysmia/issues).
